## Usage

It could be used to generate a random secure password. This homework helped me practice how to use functions and arrays within javascript.

## Credits

I primarily used the information from class activities and MDN Developer for resources. Then Also looked up some examples of functions and loops on full stack

## Contributing

I worked on the project alone but I did have some help from the Instructor Nate and TA Johnny.

## Challenges

The main challenge that I was running into during this project was the re-initiating prompts when the values were not following the guidelines.
At first I tried a while loop but that wasn't the best fit in this application, so Johnny suggested instead using functions.
After switching over the prompts/confirms to functions I kept running into the error where it would return the value as undefined when not following the guidelines
Nate took a look and noticed that I had a return on the desired value but not on the function if they made a wrong choice.
